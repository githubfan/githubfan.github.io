    <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
    <h3>Websites</h3>
    <h2>KinqAayan </h2> <a href=""></a> 
    <p>This was a website for a youtuber that wanted another way to connect with his fans.
        He also took one of four coding courses.
        This was his review: <br/> <br/>
        It's very good. The service is extremely reliable. There's lots of helpful tips as wel
        that improves your coding skills pretty fast. It even has its own system if ur confused 
        you could easily contact it by using the website command. So useful if you want to 
        be a coding master. Really cheap price as well other website offers a lot of money, 
        but this one is completly different you could rely on it low cost just amazing
         5 stars.
    </p>

    <h2>Synvpse </h2>
    <p>This was for a gamer who wanted a simple, one page landing page to show anyone his links
        for his multiple accounts in a quick way, without texting people the same infomation 
    repeptitively. </p>
    <p>This was his review: <br/> <br/>
        This site is very well done, the work is well supplied, and of good quality. Coding 
        Master is extremely experienced coder. I recommend this site for people who cannot 
        code. I will give 10/10 for this site which is very well done, for
         a low price. You can choose anything you want in the site and your ideas are taken into
         careful consideration and acted on almost immediately. For those who cannot code,
          I advise you to speak to Coding Master and I can assure you that you will get
        what you want at the best price. </p>
